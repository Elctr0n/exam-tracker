# ðŸš€ PrepDyno Flask App Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Option: Railway Deployment

Railway is perfect for your Flask app with Firebase authentication. Here's how to deploy:

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
Your app is already deployment-ready with:
- âœ… `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- âœ… `Procfile` for web server configuration
- âœ… `runtime.txt` specifying Python version
- âœ… Flask app properly configured

### ðŸš€ Option 1: Railway Web Dashboard (Recommended - No CLI needed)

#### Step 1: Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
3. Verify your account

#### Step 2: Deploy from GitHub
1. **Upload your code to GitHub first:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Upload all files from `G:\New folder\` to the repository
   - Make sure to include: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`, `templates/`, `static/`

2. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Click "New Project" on Railway dashboard
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your PrepDyno repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
   - Click "Deploy"

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PORT=5000
   ```

#### Step 4: Get Your Deployment URL
- Railway will provide a URL like: `https://prepdyno-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
- Your app will be live at this URL

### ðŸš€ Option 2: Railway CLI (If you want to install CLI)

#### Install Railway CLI:
```powershell
# Using npm (if you have Node.js)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Or using PowerShell (Windows)
iwr https://railway.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Deploy with CLI:
```bash
cd "G:\New folder"
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### ðŸš€ Option 3: Alternative - Render.com

If Railway doesn't work, try Render:

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Environment**: Python 3

### ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Steps

#### 1. Fix Firebase Authentication
Once deployed, you'll get a URL like `https://your-app.railway.app`

**Add this domain to Firebase:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `tracker-4fd2b`
3. Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Authorized domains
4. Add your new domain:
   - `your-app.railway.app`
   - `https://your-app.railway.app`

#### 2. Test Your Deployment
1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Test all features:
   - âœ… Landing page loads
   - âœ… Expandable exam cards work
   - âœ… "Start Your Journey" button works
   - âœ… Google Sign-in works (after adding domain to Firebase)
   - âœ… Dashboard and tracker pages work

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After deployment:
- **Live URL**: Your app will be accessible worldwide
- **HTTPS**: Automatic SSL certificate
- **Fast**: CDN-powered delivery
- **Scalable**: Handles traffic automatically
- **Firebase Auth**: Works perfectly with your setup

### ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

#### If deployment fails:
1. Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
2. Ensure `Procfile` exists with: `web: gunicorn app:app`
3. Verify `runtime.txt` has: `python-3.11.0`
4. Check Railway logs for specific errors

#### If Google Sign-in still fails:
1. Verify you added the deployed domain to Firebase authorized domains
2. Check browser console for specific Firebase errors
3. Ensure Firebase config is correct in your templates

### ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Railway/Render deployment logs
2. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
3. Ensure Firebase domains are configured
4. Test locally first to ensure everything works

Once deployed, your PrepDyno exam tracker will be:
- âœ… Live and accessible worldwide
- âœ… Secure with HTTPS
- âœ… Fast and reliable
- âœ… Ready for users to sign up and track their exam progress
